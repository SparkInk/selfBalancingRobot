# selfBalancingRobot

This project was made as a part of the Mechatronics project course at British Columbia Institute of Technology.
Its challenge is to simulate the behaviour of the inverted pendulum by means of a self-balancing robot.

Due to the insufficient amount of torque in the driving motors, the robot could not balance for more than 2 seconds. 
After that time, the robot kept gaining speed and would eventually fall.

As to the future improvements, new motors with a higher torque will be purchased, installed, 
and the whole system will be tested with the same firmware and the same microcontroller.
